Required Elements
Javascript:
We have an ImageStore object that stores state, essentially our entire back-end structure.
We are using 3 arrays, a prev, current, and next array, for pre-loading images so our ajax calls don't slow the user down.

Canvas
The logo for the project is made using a canvas, and this is also re-implemented in the modal window, as another canvas.
This makes it not-copyable :) Please see canvas.js for code.

HTML:
Lots, everywhere. We are using a JQuery plugin called Roundabout, for which, in our html, we have a div, with separate divs,
where each div represents one "slide", that moves around in the carousel. A lot of this basic structure is defined in HTML.
Also, we have a modal form done in HTMl, with a select drop down menu for selecting the subreddit.

CSS:
Using hover and active pseudoclasses for a button, also using css to display the modal well, etc.
Files to see:
own_style.css
modal_style.css
default_skin.css

DOM manipulation:
We are using extensive dom manipulation to insert comments, titles, images dynamically into the carousel.
It makes our project go round -- literally.

AJAX and/or JSON-P client:
Making JSONP request to reddit API for list of images from subreddit.
Take this list, and per-image, if this image is not display-able, and for imgur, make AJAX call to imgur
to get a display-able image URL.
Making another AJAX call to reddit, given image, to get the top comment.
Please look in app.js doAll() function.

jQuery:
Using Jquery to make the ajax calls and perform dom manipulation, detecting Firefox or not, etc.

CODE THAT'S NOT OURS:
fancybox
jquery.roundabout.min.js
jquery.simplemodal.js
own_style.css 213-228 lines.
Most of the images aren't ours either -- if you want more details regarding them, please let us know.
